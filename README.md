# ESC-Six-step

ESC-Six-step is a bare-metal BLDC motor controller implementing six-step commutation on a microcontroller platform.

The firmware is written without an operating system to ensure full control over timing, interrupts, and hardware resources. It includes:

- Six-step trapezoidal commutation logic
- Deterministic real-time control loop
- CAN bus communication interface
- CLI-based debug and monitoring protocol
- Low-level peripheral drivers (timers, ADC, GPIO, interrupts)

The project is structured with clean embedded architecture principles, emphasizing maintainability, traceability, and scalability. It is designed as a professional-grade foundation for motor control systems and advanced embedded development.
